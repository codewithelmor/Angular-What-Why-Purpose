# Introduction

**Angular** is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google and a community of developers. It is written in TypeScript and allows developers to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) with a rich user interface. Here are some key reasons why Angular is widely used and its main purposes:

1. **Declarative UI**:
Angular uses HTML as the template language and extends its syntax to express the components of your application in a clear and declarative manner. This makes it easier to understand and maintain the structure of your application.

2. **Two-way Data Binding**:
Angular provides two-way data binding, which means that changes in the user interface (UI) are automatically reflected in the application's data model and vice versa. This simplifies the synchronization of the UI and the underlying data.

3. **Modularity**:
Angular encourages the development of modular applications. You can break down your application into smaller, reusable components, which makes it easier to manage and scale your codebase.

4. **Dependency Injection**:
Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that helps manage the components and services in your application. This promotes the development of loosely coupled and highly maintainable code.

5. **MVVM Architecture**:
Angular follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, where the model represents the application's data, the view displays the data, and the view-model manages the communication between the view and the model. This separation of concerns enhances code organization and maintainability.

6. **Cross-browser Compatibility**:
Angular takes care of many cross-browser compatibility issues, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with browser-specific quirks.

7. **Built-in Directives and Pipes**:
Angular provides a set of built-in directives and pipes that make it easy to manipulate the DOM, format data, and perform various operations within your templates.

8. **Testing**:
Angular is designed with testability in mind. It comes with built-in testing utilities and supports tools like Jasmine and Karma for writing and running tests. This makes it easier to ensure the reliability and correctness of your code.

9. **Rich Ecosystem**:
Angular has a large and active community, as well as a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and extensions that can be leveraged to enhance development productivity.

In summary, **Angular** is a powerful framework for building dynamic and modular web applications. It provides a structured approach to development, making it easier to create and maintain large-scale applications while offering features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a rich set of tools for testing and development.

# Commands

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
